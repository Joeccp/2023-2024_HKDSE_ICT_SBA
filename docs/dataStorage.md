# Data storage

Data is automatically saved.

***Each time saving data will cover the previous saved data.***

Houses and tickets data are stored at `SBA/data/houses` and `SBA/data/tickets` 
(without a filename extension), the colour scheme setting is stored at `SBA/data/colour.txt`,
the language option is stored at `SBA/data/language.txt`
if there are no such files, the program will create them if needed.

When the program is started, it will try to load data.

See documentation on how to change the [colour scheme](colour.md) and [language](language.md).
