# Data storage

Data is automatically saved.

**Each time saving data will cover the previous saved data.**

Data are stored at `SBA/data/houses` and `SBA/data/tickets` (without a filename extension), 
if there are no such files, the program will create them.

When the program is started, it will try to load data.

> Technical details:

> Those files are NOT human-readable.

Saved data will also be deleted.
