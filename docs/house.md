# Cinema house

A cinema 'house' is the basic component of a cinema. 
Each house has a 2-D rectangular seating plan with **1-99 row(s)** and **1-26 column(s)**. 
The seating plan of a house is fixed and cannot be changed later.

Every seat of the seating plan has one of the three following status:
- _Empty_ -- available for sale
- _Sold_ -- occupied and not for sale
- _Reserved_ -- reserved by administrator and not for sale

Each house can have a movie name, which indicates the currently playing movie.

Each house has a unique house number, which is used to identify different houses.
