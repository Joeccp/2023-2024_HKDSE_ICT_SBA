The language option is saved at `data/language.txt`.

Every time this program is executed, it reads `data/language.txt`
and load the corresponding language. 
If there is no such file, the program will create one for you.

## HOWTO: Change the colour scheme
Login as **administrator**, enter mode `15`(Change the language).

The colour scheme will be changed to a **different** language and be saved.

It also affects the user menu.
