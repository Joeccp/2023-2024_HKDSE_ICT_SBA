# Login


Login is required to access the system.

To login, enter the username then the password.
Password will not be shown when you are typing.

Due to the fact that this is just an SBA homework, and is in Elective Part D,
hashed usernames and passwords are stored in `accounts.toml`, 
instead of using any kind of web-server and database.

Here are all the user accounts:

| Username | Password | Account Type  |
|:--------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|  admin   |  pass,   | Administrator |
|   user   |  bhjs.   |     User      |

Leading and trailing whitespaces are automatically ignored.
